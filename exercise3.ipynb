    "The Model: The team is using a modern object detection model (like YOLO or SSD).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Process: The model's performance is measured by a \"Total Loss\" function. For object detection, this loss is a \n",
    "combination of two things:\n",
    "    - Classification Loss: Did the model correctly identify the object in the box as a \"stop_sign\"?\n",
    "    - Localization Loss: How accurately did the model draw the bounding box around the real stop sign? \n",
    "      (A perfect box gets low loss; an offset or poorly sized box gets high loss).\n",
