After using a fairly complex and intensive model that took a long time to train during Iteration 1, the team decided to reduce the number of input variables and use a simpler model that they could iterate on quicker. The hope was that between reducing the number of variables and using a faster, simpler model, that results could be views and the model parameters tuned quicker to zero in on a model that works well."

The team has decided that other signs provide information that is useful for other driving functions and a more integrated image classification approach is going to be best."

Now that we have different colored signs, we add a color variable to the inputs to see if that will make a difference with this existing model that is close to working properly. It is noted that the only traffic signs in the US (other countries will need to be address differently) that are primarily red are ones that mean STOP (stop sign, do not enter, wrong way, etc.) or you might need to STOP (yield, upcoming light, etc.) the hope is that adding this variable will work."
